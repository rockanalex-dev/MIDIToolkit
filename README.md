# MIDIToolkit

## **Enhanced MIDI manipulation library with immutable, chainable operations built on the classic MIDI.py module by Peter Billam**

MIDIToolkit provides a high‑level, Pythonic interface for reading, transforming, and writing MIDI files. It wraps the classic `MIDI.py` parser with a modern layer of immutable objects, event wrappers, track abstractions, tempo mapping utilities, and a plugin system designed for expressive, safe, and reusable MIDI processing workflows.

---

## Key Features

- **Immutable, chainable operations** — Every transformation returns a new `MIDIFile` instance.
- **Typed event wrappers** — `NoteEvent`, `TempoEvent`, `PatchChangeEvent`, `ControlChangeEvent`, `KeySignatureEvent`, and more.
- **Track abstraction** — Filter, map, sort, copy, and inspect metadata such as duration, pitch range, and channels used.
- **TempoMap utilities** — Convert between ticks, milliseconds, and beats with full support for tempo changes.
- **Plugin system** — Extend functionality with custom plugins; includes a registry for discovery and invocation.
- **Comprehensive transformations** — Transpose, scale velocities, quantize, segment, time‑shift, merge, mix, concatenate, and grep channels.
- **Analysis & reporting** — Statistics, instrument lookup, key signature lookup, text events, validation, and human‑readable summaries.
- **Flexible I/O** — Load from file, bytes, opus list, or score list; save to disk or memory.
- **Lazy loading** — Delay file parsing until data is accessed.
- **Playback** — Cross‑platform MIDI playback using available system tools.

## Installation

MIDIToolkit requires only Python 3. Download the two core files and place them in your project directory or Python path:

- [`MIDI.py`](https://github.com/asigalov61/MIDIToolkit/blob/main/MIDI.py) — classic MIDI parser  
- [`MIDIToolkit.py`](https://github.com/asigalov61/MIDIToolkit/blob/main/MIDIToolkit.py) — enhanced toolkit

Or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asigalov61/MIDIToolkit.git
cd MIDIToolkit
```

Import the toolkit:

```python
from MIDIToolkit import MIDIFile
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from MIDIToolkit import MIDIFile

# Load a MIDI file (lazy loading by default)
midi = MIDIFile("example.mid")

# Inspect basic properties
print(midi.ticks_per_quarter)   # e.g. 480
print(midi.num_tracks)          # number of tracks

# Get all notes
notes = midi.get_notes()
print(f"Total notes: {len(notes)}")

# Transpose all notes up by 2 semitones
transposed = midi.transpose(2)

# Save the result
transposed.save("transposed.mid")
```
